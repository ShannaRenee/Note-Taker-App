# Note Taker App



## Description
The purpose of this note taker app is to provide a way for users to quickly and easily write and save notes so that they can remember important dates or tasks. I was motivated to create this app so that I can use it for my own todo lists, and to help me remember important dates. While making this project I was able to better understand how to use the fs module so that I can read and write to files.
